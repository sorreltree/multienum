class MultiEnum(int):
    """Enumeration type as int sublcass with support for multiple names

    Implementation should define _members, which is a tuple of tuples.  The
    first value of each of the internal tuples should be an integer (or else
    it will be implicitly cast as such) and will be the stored value for the
    instane.  All subsequent values will be names by which that int can be
    called.  The value can be instantiated with any of the names provided
    either using the appropriate field name as a keyword, or, so long as it is
    unique across all fields, as an un-keyworded argument.  There is no test
    to ensure that names are unique -- if a name appears multiple times in the
    _members tuples, the behavior is undefined.

    If more than one argument is given, either keyworded or not, a ValueError
    exception will be raised unless all arguments resolve to the same value.

    The ``MultiEnum`` type makes an attempt to be idempotent -- i.e., if ``x``
    is an ``MultiEnum``, ``x is MultiEnum(x)`` should be true.  However, in
    the case of multiple init values, idempotency is only preserved for the
    first positional parameter.  ``x is MultiEnum(a, x)`` will not be true,
    even if ``a`` and ``x`` are equal.

    By default, the first in each individual enumerated tuple will be returned
    if the value is cast as a string (using the str() function, for instance).
    For compatability with the types in the enum module, the same value will
    be returned using the 'name' attribute.
